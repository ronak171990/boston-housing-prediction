# Boston Housing Price Prediction 🏡📈

This project uses a machine learning model to predict Boston housing prices based on features such as crime rate, number of rooms, accessibility to highways, and more.

---

## 📊 Project Structure

- **R² Score**: 0.86 _(example — add actual value from model evaluation)_
---

## 💡 Objective

Build a regression model to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (`MEDV`) in Boston using multiple features from the dataset.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- joblib (for model saving)
